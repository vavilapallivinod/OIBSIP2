He plays as a right-handed batsman for India national cricket team in international cricket, Mumbai Indians in IPL and for Mumbai in domestic cricket. Rohit also captains Mumbai Indians and the team has won 5 titles under his leadership, the most by any team.

            <p>Ritika, who works as a sports event organizer, is also Yuvraj's sister(cousin). They had known each other for six years before getting married. Thus, Yuvraj had warned Rohit Sharma to maintain a distance from Ritika Sajdeh when they met for an ad shoot. Although Rohit first disliked Ritika, they later became good friends as they understood each other better. Moreover, soon after, they began dating. Rohit and Ritika had met at their workplace. Ritika is a sporting event organizer who used to be Rohit's organizer and was in charge of his cricket activities. After having dated for six years, Rohit wanted to surprise his love. So, Rohit proposed to Ritika in a spot that held a special place in his heart. At the Borivali Sports Club in Mumbai, he got down on his knees and proposed to her with a diamond ring in his hand. After getting engaged, the wedding date for Rohit Sharma and Ritika Sajdeh was set for December 13, 2015. In Mumbai's Taj Lands Resort, a celebrity marriage took place. Celebrities from the cricket, cinema and economic worlds witnessed their spectacular marriage. After three years of happy marriage, Ritika Sajdeh and Rohit Sharma welcomed a lovely girl child into their home on December 30, 2018. However, they took a little time to reveal their daughter's name, but eventually, through an Instagram post, Rohit Sharma revealed the child's name as Samaira.
